# Boundary-Detection

# Introduction

Boundary detection and image classification are two well
known computer vision problems. The challenging part of
the boundary detection is when we are doing the boundary
detection from a single image. Is this case we cannot use most
of the recent deep learning methods. In this project I use the most recent
pb (probability of boundary) boundary detection algorithm and compare it to [Canny](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4767851) and [Sobel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator) baselines.
